      I craft engaging websites that merge innovation with user-centered design.
      Beyond coding, I thrive in staying ahead of industry trends through
      continuous learning and collaboration with the developer community. Always
      driven to tackle challenges, I bring a balance of technical expertise and
      a creative mindset to every project.Outside of coding, I practice
      bouldering and play tennis that strengthen my perseverance, focus, and
      teamwork skills.
