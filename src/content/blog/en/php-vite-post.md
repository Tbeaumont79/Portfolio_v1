# Introduction

Today at school my teatcher ask me to create a simple CRUD app with PHP and MySQL, so i decided to give it a try and learn how to use Vite with PHP. The main idea behind this is that i wanted to try to install tailwind with vite on my project and have access to the javascript Ecosystem in my php project.

## Quick reminder what is Vite ?

For those who don't know, Vite is a build tool that allows you to create fast and efficient web applications by automatically optimizing your code and dependencies during development. This post won't go in detail about Vite if you want more information you can read the [official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

# How to use Vite with PHP

First we will need to init the project with npm :

```bash
npm init -y
```

Then we will need to install vite and the vite plugin for php :

```bash
npm install vite && npm install vite-plugin-php
```

After that we can create our vite.config.ts file based on the documentation of the [vite plugin for php](https://vite-php.nititech.de/)

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import usePHP from "vite-plugin-php";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [usePHP()],
});
```

Make sure you have those scripts defined in your package.json file:

```js
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build"
}
```

Then you can type `npm run dev` to start the development server.

The development server should start, and you should be able to access your app at http://localhost:5173. Youâ€™ll see your index.php file in the browser.

In your project folder, a hidden directory named .php-tmp will be created. This is where Vite stores the compiled files.

## Declaring Entry Files

For each PHP file that should be handled by Vite, you need to include it in the entry option of the plugin configuration. Here's an example with Tailwind CSS integration:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import usePHP from "vite-plugin-php";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		usePHP({
			entry: [
				"index.php",
				"app/auth/*.php",
				"app/dashboard/*.php",
				"app/dashboard/**/*.php",
				"app/databases/*.php",
				"app/utils/*.php",
			],
		}),
		tailwindcss(),
	],
});

```
