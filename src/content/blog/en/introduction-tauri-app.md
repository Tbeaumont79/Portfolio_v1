# Introduction

In this article we will look at "Tauri" ....

# Setup

First we create a new Tauri project using this command. I'm using `pnpm` for the package manager but you can take whatever you want.

```sh
  pnpm create tauri-app
```

Next you can choose a Project Name, and the language personnaly i have choose typescript.

After that you can choose your ui template, i will go for vanilla because this project is a study project we are supposed to use vanilla.

We can type :

```sh
  pnpm install
```

And finally :

```sh
  pnpm tauri dev
```
